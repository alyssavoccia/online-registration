This is my 3rd project for the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. In this project I used flexbox for the layout of the website along with HTML5 form elements. The most challenging aspect of this project for me was the alignment of the labels and input boxes in the contact section, because I wasn't sure how to get them to align properly with the zip code input being shorter than the rest of the inputs. One of the major things I would like to work on in future projects is making my CSS code cleaner and more readable because I feel that I am repeating code when it is not necessary.
